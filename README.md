# Nomad_BASE
Arduino driver for OLD_Nomad scourt via OPENCR

##As Github mentioned, this code is in 2020 GitHub Archive Program and frozen in the Arctic Code Vault???

##What mankind gonna do with a old PID motor controller in 2150, should I include a c++ quantum engine driver lib just in case they might need it?

###I think quantum engine in 2150 use PWM singal via a 5V usb cable anyway. They should be fine. And usb always backward compatible am I right?
